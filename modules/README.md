## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

  Map of application identifiers ‚Üí { appName, installMethod = "nix" | "flatpak" | null, extraArgs? }.

- **config.hm.managedFlatpaks.ids**
  (List of strings) Flatpak App IDs to install. Merged across modules.

- **home.packages**
  Automatically populated from applications.nix and packages.nix.

- **config.sops**
  Keys for decrypting your nixos/secrets/*.sops.yaml.

- **config.xdg**
  xdg.configHome, xdg.dataHome, etc., to override where your dotfiles live.

- Module‚Äêspecific options under programs, services, vim, stylix, etc.‚Äîrefer to each Nix file's top comments for details.
